Discovered with Jack, Rose tells Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. She suggests to an indifferent Cal that Jack deserves a reward. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cals engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to tell Cal of the collision, he has his butler slip the necklace into Jacks pocket and accuses him of theft. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the RMS Carpathia takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson.
