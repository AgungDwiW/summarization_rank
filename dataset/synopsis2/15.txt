An acquaintance from college, Gavin Elster, asks Scottie to follow his wife, Madeleine, claiming she has been possessed. Scottie reluctantly agrees, and follows Madeleine: to a florist where she buys a bouquet of flowers; to the grave of Carlotta Valdes at Mission Dolores; to an art museum where she gazes at Portrait of Carlotta, which resembles her. A flashback reveals that Judy was the person Scottie knew as Madeleine Elster ; she was impersonating Gavins wife as part of a murder plot. They begin seeing each other, but Scottie remains obsessed with Madeleine and asks Judy to change her clothes and hair so that she once more resembles Madeleine. Judy confesses that Gavin paid her to impersonate a possessed Madeleine; Gavin faked the suicide by throwing the body of his wife from the bell tower.
