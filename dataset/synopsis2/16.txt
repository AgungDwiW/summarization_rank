Some years earlier, Terry had been a promising boxer, until Friendly had Charley instruct him to deliberately lose a fight that he could have won, so that Friendly could win money betting against him. Although Terry resents being used as a tool in Joeys death, and despite Father Barrys impassioned sermon on the docks reminding the longshoremen that Christ walks among them and that every murder is a Calvary, Terry is nevertheless willing to remain D and D . As Terry, tormented by his awakening conscience, increasingly leans toward testifying, Friendly decides that Terry must be killed unless Charley can coerce him into keeping quiet. Charley tries bribing Terry with a good job and finally threatens Terry by holding a gun against him, but recognizes that he has failed to sway Terry, who places the blame for his own downward spiral on his well-off brother. Terry sets out to shoot Friendly, but Father Barry obstructs that course of action and finally convinces Terry to fight Friendly by testifying. Finally the confrontation develops into a vicious brawl, with Terry getting the upper hand until Friendlys thugs gang up on Terry and nearly beat him to death.
