Dorothy and Toto get in trouble with a cruel neighbor, Miss Almira Gulch, when Toto bites her. The Witch of the West swears revenge on Dorothy and Toto for her sisters death. At the castle, the Witch again fails to get the slippers off of Dorothy due to a magical barrier, and remembers that Dorothy first has to be killed. The Witch then sets fire to the Scarecrow, and Dorothy instinctively splashes a nearby bucket of water onto the flames; the Witch is also hit by it and melts. He then prepares to get Dorothy home in his hot air balloon, but as Toto runs away to chase a cat, Dorothy follows, and it leaves without her.
