Later, while fleeing from repossession men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion. Ushered in by Max, the butler, Joe recognizes the woman as long-forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond. Betty thinks a scene in one of Joes scripts has potential, but Joe is uninterested. When Joe phones Max to have him pack his things, Max tells him Norma cut her wrists with his razor. Norma discovers a manuscript with Joes and Bettys names on it.
