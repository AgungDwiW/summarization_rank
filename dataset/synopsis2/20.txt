The galaxy is in a civil war, and spies for the Rebel Alliance have stolen plans to the Galactic Empires Death Star, a heavily armed and armored space station capable of destroying an entire planet. Rebel leader Princess Leia is in possession of the plans, but her ship is captured by Imperial forces under the command of the evil lord Darth Vader. The next morning, Luke finds R2-D2 searching for Obi-Wan, and meets Ben Kenobi, who reveals himself to be Obi-Wan. Contrary to his uncles statements, Luke learns that his father fought alongside Obi-Wan as a Jedi Knight before he was betrayed and killed by Vader, Obi-Wans former pupil who turned to the dark side of the Force. Obi-Wan views Leias complete message in which she begs him to take the Death Star plans to her home planet of Alderaan and give them to her father for analysis. Helped by spiritual guidance from Obi-Wan to use the Force, Luke successfully destroys the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the rebel base.
