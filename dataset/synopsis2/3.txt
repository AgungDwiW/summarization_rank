Schindler hires Jewish workers because they cost less, while Stern ensures that as many people as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps or killed. Schindler asks Goeth to allow him to move his workers to a new munitions factory he plans to build in his home town of Zwittau-Brinnlitz. Schindler and Stern create Schindlers List a list of people to be transferred to Brinnlitz and thus saved from transport to Auschwitz. The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role saving Jewish lives, together with a ring engraved with a Talmudic quotation: Whoever saves one life saves the world entire. After some scenes depicting Goeths execution and a summary of Schindlers later life events after the war, the black-and-white frame changes to a color shot of actual Schindlerjuden at Schindlers grave in Jerusalem.
