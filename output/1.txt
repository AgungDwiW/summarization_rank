Michael takes refuge in Sicily, and Fredo Corleone is sheltered by associate Moe Greene in Las Vegas. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to a father saddened by his involvement in the family business and marries Kay the next year.
 With his father at the end of his career and his surviving brother too weak, Michael takes the reins of the family, promising Kay that he will make the business legitimate within five years. To add injury to insult, Michael sees Fredo falling under Greene's sway.
 Vito collapses and dies in his garden while playing with Michael's son, Anthony. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio arranges a meeting between Michael and Don Barzini, signalling his treachery as Vito had warned. After Carlo is questioned by Michael on his involvement in setting up Sonny's murder and confesses he was contacted by Barzini, Peter Clemenza kills him with a wire garrote. As Kay watches warily, Michael receives his capos, who address him as the new Don Corleone.
