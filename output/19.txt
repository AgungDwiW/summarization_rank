Riff invites Tony to the dance, but Tony is uninterested. Tony arrives and he and Maria fall in love at first sight and briefly kiss. 
 Maria waits for Tony on the rooftop of her apartment building, when Chino arrives and tells her about the fight. 
 Anita enters the apartment while Tony and Maria are in the bedroom. Anita spots Tony leaving through the window and chides Maria for the relationship ("A Boy Like That"), but Maria convinces her to help them elope ("I Have a Love").
 Schrank arrives and questions Maria about the rumble. Tony runs into the streets, shouting for Chino to find him and kill him as well.
 In the playground next to Doc's, Tony spots Maria and they run toward each other, only for Chino to emerge and shoot Tony.
