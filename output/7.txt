 At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett notices that she is being admired by Rhett Butler, who has been disowned by his family. Rhett overhears their conversation, but promises Scarlett he will keep her secret. Rhett makes an inordinately large bid for Scarlett and, to the disapproval of the guests, Scarlett agrees to dance with him. Scarlett calls upon Rhett to bring her home to Tara immediately with Melanie, Prissy, and the baby. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Realizing that Ashley only ever truly loved Melanie, Scarlett dashes after Rhett to find him preparing to leave for good.
