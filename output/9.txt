Dorothy Gale lives with her dog Toto on the farm of her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. Dorothy and Toto get in trouble with a cruel neighbor, Miss Almira Gulch, when Toto bites her. The Witch of the West swears revenge on Dorothy and Toto for her sister's death. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, where the Wizard of Oz might be able to help her get back home.
On her way to the Emerald City, Dorothy meets and befriends the Scarecrow who wants a brain, the Tin Woodman who desires a heart, and the Cowardly Lion who is in need of courage. At the castle, the Witch again fails to get the slippers off of Dorothy due to a magical barrier, and remembers that Dorothy first has to be killed. He then prepares to get Dorothy home in his hot air balloon, but as Toto runs away to chase a cat, Dorothy follows, and it leaves without her.
