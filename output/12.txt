 
 On the occasion of the 1958 first communion party for his son, Michael Corleone has a series of meetings in his role as the Don of his crime family. Fredo brings Michael the money for a deal with Roth, but instead of turning it over to Roth, Michael asks who put out the hit on Pentangeli. Back home, Tom informs Michael that Roth is recovering in Miami and that Kay's pregnancy has miscarried.
Three years later, two more sons—Fredo and Michael—have been born to Vito. Terrified, he returns to assure Vito that the widow can stay, along with her dog, at a reduced rent.
 
 Michael and Tom observe that Roth's strategy to destroy Michael is well planned. At the funeral, a reformed Connie implores Michael to forgive Fredo. Vito is heard at the door and all but Michael leave the room to greet him.
 
 
 Michael sits alone by the lake at the family compound.
