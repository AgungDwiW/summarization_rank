 Soon both Edie and Father Barry urge Terry to testify. Charley tries bribing Terry with a good job and finally threatens Terry by holding a gun against him, but recognizes that he has failed to sway Terry, who places the blame for his own downward spiral on his well-off brother. "I coulda' been a contender", laments Terry to his brother, "Instead of a bum, which is what I am â€“ let's face it." Charley gives Terry the gun and advises him to run. Terry sets out to shoot Friendly, but Father Barry obstructs that course of action and finally convinces Terry to fight Friendly by testifying.
 After the testimony, Friendly announces that Terry will not find employment anywhere on the waterfront. When he is the only man not hired, Terry openly confronts Friendly, calling him out and proclaiming that he is proud of what he did.
 Finally the confrontation develops into a vicious brawl, with Terry getting the upper hand until Friendly's thugs gang up on Terry and nearly beat him to death. The dockworkers, who witnessed the confrontation, declare their support for Terry and refuse to work unless Terry is working too.
