German Major Strasser has come to Casablanca to see that Laszlo does not succeed.
 When Laszlo makes inquiries, Ferrari, a major underworld figure and Rick's friendly business rival, divulges his suspicion that Rick has the letters. In private, Rick refuses to sell at any price, telling Laszlo to ask his wife the reason. In retaliation, Strasser has Renault close the club.
 That night, Ilsa confronts Rick in the deserted caf√©. When Laszlo unexpectedly shows up, having narrowly escaped a police raid on a Resistance meeting, Rick has waiter Carl spirit Ilsa away. When the police arrest Laszlo on a minor, trumped-up charge, Rick convinces Renault to release him by promising to set him up for a much more serious crime: possession of the letters of transit. When Renault tries to arrest Laszlo as arranged, Rick forces him at gunpoint to assist in their escape.
