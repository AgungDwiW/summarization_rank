McMurphy finds that they are more fearful of Ratched than they are focused on becoming functional in the outside world. While McMurphy and the Chief wait their turn, McMurphy offers Chief a piece of gum, and Chief murmurs "Thank you...Ah, Juicy Fruit." McMurphy is delighted to find that Bromden is neither deaf nor mute, and that he stays silent to deflect attention. After the electroshock therapy, McMurphy shuffles back onto the ward feigning brain damage, before humorously animating his face and loudly greeting his fellow patients, assuring everyone that the ECT only charged him up all the more and that the next woman to take him on will "light up like a pinball machine and pay off in silver dollars."
 But the struggle with Ratched is taking its toll, and with his release date no longer a certainty, McMurphy plans an escape. McMurphy insists Billy have sex with Candy right then and there. The patients pass a whispered rumor that McMurphy dramatically escaped the hospital rather than being taken "upstairs".
 Late that night, Bromden sees McMurphy being escorted back to his bed, and initially believes that he has returned so they can escape together, which he is now ready to do since McMurphy has made him feel "as big as a mountain". Unwilling to allow McMurphy to live in such a state, the Chief smothers McMurphy to death with his pillow.
