Scottie rescues her. Scottie grabs her and they embrace. Scottie follows her and she identifies herself as Judy Barton, from Salina, Kansas. Judy writes to Scottie explaining her involvement with Gavin's murder of his wife. 
 They begin seeing each other, but Scottie remains obsessed with "Madeleine" and asks Judy to change her clothes and hair so that she once more resembles Madeleine. Judy confesses that Gavin paid her to impersonate a "possessed" Madeleine; Gavin faked the suicide by throwing the body of his wife from the bell tower.
 Judy begs Scottie to forgive her, because she loves him.
